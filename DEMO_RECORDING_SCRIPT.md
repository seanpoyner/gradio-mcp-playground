Demo Recording Script for Gradio MCP Playground
==============================================

This script helps you record a compelling demo video for the hackathon.

## Pre-Recording Checklist
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs
- [ ] Clean desktop background
- [ ] Test microphone
- [ ] Start unified dashboard on port 8081
- [ ] Connect at least 3 MCP servers (filesystem, memory, search)
- [ ] Have sample files ready in ~/demo-files/

## Recording Flow (2-3 minutes)

### 1. Opening (0:00-0:15)
"Hi, I'm [Name], and I've built Gradio MCP Playground - a platform that 
transforms any Python function into an AI-powered tool in just one line of code."

[SHOW: Unified dashboard homepage]

### 2. Problem Statement (0:15-0:30)
"Today, connecting AI models to external tools requires complex integrations.
What if it was as simple as adding mcp_server=True to any Gradio app?"

[SHOW: Complex code vs simple Gradio code side-by-side]

### 3. Live Demo - AI Assistant (0:30-1:15)

[CLICK: AI Assistant tab]

"Watch our AI assistant use real MCP tools to complete tasks:"

**Demo 1: Screenshot**
Type: "Take a screenshot of python.org and save it to my desktop"
[WAIT for response showing the screenshot]

**Demo 2: Search + File Creation**
Type: "Search for the latest news about Gradio and create a summary file"
[SHOW: AI searching, then creating file]

**Demo 3: Code Generation**
Type: "Create a Python script that generates QR codes"
[SHOW: AI generating complete code]

### 4. Create MCP Server (1:15-1:45)

[CLICK: Create MCP Server tab]

"Creating your own MCP server is incredibly simple:"

[SHOW: Pre-written Fibonacci example]

"Just add mcp_server=True, and boom - your function is now:"
- A web interface
- An MCP server for AI models
- Automatically documented

[RUN: python fibonacci_server.py in terminal]
[SHOW: Server running message]

### 5. Connect & Test (1:45-2:00)

[CLICK: Connect & Test tab]

"Connect to any MCP server with one click"

[CLICK: Connect to Memory server]
[SHOW: Connection successful]

"Test tools interactively"
[CLICK: Discover Tools]
[SHOW: Tool list]

### 6. Impact & Close (2:00-2:15)

"With Gradio MCP Playground, we're democratizing AI tool development.
Any developer can now create AI-powered tools without complex integrations."

[SHOW: Gallery of example servers]

"Try it yourself at [Space URL]. Let's build the future of AI agents together!"

## Key Points to Emphasize
1. One-line transformation (mcp_server=True)
2. Real working tools (not just demos)
3. Multiple AI assistant modes
4. Active community (show Discord/GitHub stats if available)

## Backup Demos (if something fails)
1. Show pre-recorded GIF of tool in action
2. Explain the concept while showing static screenshots
3. Focus on the simplicity of the code

## Post-Recording
- [ ] Review video for audio quality
- [ ] Add captions for accessibility
- [ ] Create thumbnail with key visual
- [ ] Upload to YouTube/Vimeo (not just file upload)
- [ ] Test video playback on HF Space
